## Partizan vs Efes

A phenomenal game by the black-and-whites, crowned with victory!

### First Quarter

Partizan started well, holding a solid lead until the middle of the first period. However, Efes' fantastic backcourt had to wake up at some point, with Cordinier leading the way and scoring 11 points in the first quarter. The score at the end of the first was 31-24 for Partizan.

### Second Quarter

Partizan continued their great play and at one point built a lead of 14 points. The main contributor to this advantage was Osetkovski, who scored with ease. The black-and-whites went to halftime more satisfied, with the score at 55-43.

### Third Quarter

The curse of the third quarter struck again—Partizan managed to hold their lead until the middle of the period, but after a few bad decisions and 8 free throws awarded to Efes, the score at the end of the quarter was 71-69, erasing the advantage Partizan had for almost three quarters.

### Final Quarter

A tough start for both teams, and at one point Efes took the lead. The novelty compared to previous seasons is that Partizan finally found a player who can create points when most needed—a great basket by Shake Milton prevented Efes from increasing their lead, followed by a masterclass from Sterling Brown in attack, whose points secured Partizan's victory.
